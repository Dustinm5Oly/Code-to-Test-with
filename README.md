# Code-to-Test-with

## This webpage is to test out your javascript knowledge creating a game with high scores

    -My motivation was to quiz a user on their knowledge of javascript while making it fun by beating their last high score.
    -I built this project so I will be able test my knowledge on javascript, html and css.
    -The webpage allowed the user to start a timed quiz, answer the questions by selecting the correct answer and stop their time to create a score once all questions were answered.
    -I learned how to create a timer and flow from question to question eventually taking me to a highscores page.
